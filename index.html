				I am Deepak Ramachandran. I am a computer programmer currently pursuing 6th semester of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.
				I love writing code and building things that are conceptually interesting. I started writing code when I was 13 and I started out
				with a not-so-popular programming language "Lua". Later on, I learnt C and played around with it a little. I am fast at learning new things
				that are of interest to me. I love playing computer games because sometimes it helps me acquire innovative ideas and enables deep thinking.
				I like to draw stuff even though I'm a bad artist. I respect all rules unless and until the rules are unethical or otherwise illegal.
				I like to speak in front of large crowds and discuss with fellow programmers to obtain useful information. I consider myself as a good orator.
